# EVA-Finance Recommendation

---

## 1. Executive Assessment (Read This First)

**Recommendation:** Candidate for upward trajectory  
**Confidence Level:** High (X.XX / 1.00)  
**Signal Phase:** Acceleration  
**Signal Initiation Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  

**Summary:**  
EVA has identified **[Company Name]** as meeting its high-confidence acceleration criteria. This recommendation is based on sustained, entity-specific deviations across multiple dimensions that historically precede broader market recognition.

This is not a prediction. It is an assessment that the probability distribution has shifted.

---

## 2. Why This Company

**Core Thesis (Plain Language):**  
Describe what is changing for this company and why the change appears durable rather than transient. Focus on causality, not narrative.

This section answers:
> What is happening that wasn’t happening before?

---

## 3. Why Now (Timing Justification)

**Key Inflection Indicators:**
- Acceleration detected across consecutive observation windows  
- Intent signals progressed from exploratory → evaluative → action-oriented  
- Cross-community adoption observed (non-isolated discourse)  

**Interpretation:**  
This combination suggests the company has moved from emergence into early acceleration, where asymmetry still exists but validation is increasing.

If this section cannot be written clearly, the recommendation should not exist.

## 4. Signal Evidence

| Dimension  | Observation                              | Deviation From Baseline |
|------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Volume     | Sustained increase                       | +Xσ                      |
| Sentiment  | Stabilized upward bias                   | +Yσ                      |
| Intent     | Action-oriented language detected        | Shift confirmed          |
| Spread     | Multiple distinct communities observed   | Confirmed                |
| Novelty    | Non-recycled language patterns detected  | Present                  |

**Note:** EVA prioritizes deviation from the entity’s historical baseline over absolute magnitude.

---

## 5. Comparative Context (Why This, Not Others)

EVA evaluated **N comparable entities** within the same thematic or sector space.

**This company ranked higher because:**
- Stronger and more consistent acceleration  
- Clearer intent maturation  
- Lower suppression risk (hype, meme, or influencer contamination)  

Comparable entities that were evaluated but rejected are documented separately.

This section is mandatory.

## 6. Risks & Disconfirming Signals

**Known Risks:**
- Risk 1 (structural, competitive, regulatory, or macro)  
- Risk 2  
- Risk 3  

**Signals That Would Weaken This Recommendation:**
- Reversal in intent progression  
- Volume spike without sentiment stabilization  
- Single-community concentration  

EVA actively monitors these conditions.

---

## 7. Confidence Interpretation

**Confidence Score:** X.XX / 1.00  

This score reflects:
- Signal consistency  
- Cross-source agreement  
- Historical false-positive avoidance  

It does **not** represent certainty of outcome.  
It represents EVA’s confidence that this pattern is materially different from noise.

---

## 8. Post-Recommendation Tracking

**Review Windows:**
- 30 days  
- 90 days  
- 180 days  

**Post-Mortem Required:** Yes  
**Outcome Classification:** Pending  

Regardless of outcome, this recommendation will be reviewed to refine EVA’s detection logic.

---

## 9. Final Note

EVA issues recommendations infrequently by design.  
This assessment represents a threshold crossing, not a casual opinion.
